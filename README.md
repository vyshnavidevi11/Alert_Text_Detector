## Overview ℹ️

Alert Text Detector is built using BERTweet Base, a transformer model specifically tailored for Twitter data. Our model has been trained on a dataset of 23,000 tweets, including both alert and non-alert messages. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can accurately identify emergency-related messages and classify tweets based on their textual content.

## Features ✨

🔹 **Alert Detection:** Quickly identify and flag messages containing alerts or emergency information.
🔹 **Text Classification:** Categorize tweets based on the nature of the content, enabling quick analysis and response.
🔹 **High Accuracy:** Benefit from the power of machine learning and NLP to ensure precise detection and classification.
